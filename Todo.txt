So far we've got a count down happening and some times.

Wiring up the pins. UNO.

Change the keypad to use a separate serial line.

Change output to use the LCD, which is also serial. 
  Serial.println("WRONG CODE");
  // Might need to use a library here

Write the time to the display in UpdateDisplay

Display count down. Looks like we can use 2 digits for minutes, 2 for seconds and 1 for 1/10 of second. Will need to parse the "RemainingTime" from the main timer which is in Miliseconds into a string to send to that display.
